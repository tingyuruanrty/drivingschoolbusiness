        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Do I need a DMV appointment before renting a car?</strong
            ><br />
            Yes. You must have a confirmed DMV road test appointment before
            renting our vehicle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Can I rent a car if I only have a learner’s permit?</strong
            ><br />
            Yes. A valid learner’s permit is enough to rent our car for the DMV
            test.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >I just moved to California. Can I rent a car for the
              test?</strong
            ><br />
            Yes. Whether you’re a new resident or moved from another state, you
            can rent our vehicle for the DMV test.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Can international students or drivers with a foreign license rent
              a car?</strong
            ><br />
            Yes. Unlike big rental companies, we provide DMV-approved vehicles
            for international students and drivers without a U.S. license.
          </li>

        <h2>3. Vehicle &amp; DMV Requirements</h2>
        <ol start="8">
          <li>
            <strong>Are your cars DMV-approved?</strong><br />
            Yes. All our cars meet DMV safety standards and include full
            insurance coverage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What type of cars do you provide?</strong><br />
            We provide compact sedans that are easy to operate and suitable for
            DMV testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do the cars have all the required safety features?</strong
            ><br />
            Yes. Each car has seatbelts, mirrors, working lights, and all
            DMV-required equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Can I use Hertz, Enterprise, or other rental cars for the DMV
              test?</strong
            ><br />
            No. Most traditional rental companies do not allow their cars to be
            used for DMV road tests. We specialize in DMV test rentals.

            as a convenience and is not a taxi or rideshare service.
